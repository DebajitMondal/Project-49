  <p><i>Interesting Facts about Pigeon</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
    <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li>
    <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds</li>
